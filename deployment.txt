# Deployment Checklist for ID Card Genie

## 1. Prepare the Codebase
- [ ] Clone the repository to your local machine or server.
- [ ] Install dependencies: `npm install`
- [ ] Review and update project documentation (README.md).

## 2. Environment Variables
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` (for local) or set environment variables in your host's dashboard (for production).
- [ ] Set all required environment variables:
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
    - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
    - `BREVO_API_KEY`
    - `SENDER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`
    - `RECIEVER_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL`
    - `FIREBASE_ADMIN_CREDENTIALS` (CRITICAL for production - copy the entire JSON content from firebase-admin-sdk-credentials.json as a single line)
    - Any other secrets required by the client
- [ ] **Never commit `.env.local` or any file with secrets to git.**

## 3. Firebase Setup
- [ ] Ensure the client has a Firebase project set up.
- [ ] Obtain and configure Firebase Admin SDK credentials (`firebase-admin-sdk-credentials.json`).
- [ ] Set up Firestore and Storage security rules for production.

## 4. Brevo (Sendinblue) Setup
- [ ] Create a Brevo account for the client.
- [ ] Generate and copy the API key.
- [ ] Add and verify the sender email address in Brevo.
- [ ] (Recommended) Set up a custom domain and configure DKIM/DMARC for better deliverability.

## 5. Vercel/Hosting Setup
- [ ] Connect the repository to Vercel (or chosen host).
- [ ] Set all environment variables in the host's dashboard.
- [ ] Configure custom domains if needed.

## 6. Build and Deploy
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to ensure the app builds successfully.
- [ ] Deploy to production (e.g., `vercel --prod`).
- [ ] Monitor deployment logs for errors.

## 7. Post-Deployment
- [ ] Test all critical flows (login, email, uploads, downloads).
- [ ] Check Brevo and Firebase dashboards for activity/errors.
- [ ] Monitor logs for runtime errors.

## 8. Security
- [ ] Ensure `.env.local`, `firebase-admin-sdk-credentials.json`, and any other secret files are listed in `.gitignore`.
- [ ] Review and update security rules and access controls as needed.

**Note:**
- Never share or commit sensitive information (API keys, credentials) to version control.
- Always use environment variables for secrets.

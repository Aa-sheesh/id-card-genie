# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Scalable Architecture for Large Deployments

This application has been optimized for Vercel deployment with **scalable architecture** that can handle:
- **5000+ students per school**
- **100+ schools**
- **Unlimited total images**

### Current Configuration
- **Vercel Function Timeout**: 60 seconds (configured in `vercel.json`)
- **API Route Timeout**: 50 seconds (with custom timeout handling)
- **Compression Level**: Reduced from 9 to 6 for faster processing
- **Smart Scaling**: Automatic detection of large deployments

### Scalable File Processing

#### Small Schools (≤1000 images)
- **Maximum Files**: 100 images per ZIP
- **Compression**: Level 6 (balanced speed/size)
- **Timeout Protection**: Automatic file limit enforcement
- **Vercel Compatible**: ✅ Yes

#### Large Schools (>1000 images)
- **Excel Generation**: ✅ Unlimited images listed
- **ZIP Content**: Excel file + README with download instructions
- **Firebase Storage**: Direct access links provided
- **Vercel Compatible**: ✅ Yes (no timeout issues)

#### Small Deployments (≤50 schools)
- **Maximum Schools**: 10 schools per ZIP
- **Maximum Total Files**: 200 files across all schools
- **Files Per School**: Distributed evenly (20 files per school)
- **Vercel Compatible**: ✅ Yes

#### Large Deployments (>50 schools)
- **Excel Generation**: ✅ All schools (unlimited)
- **ZIP Content**: Excel files for all schools + comprehensive README
- **Firebase Storage**: Direct access links and CLI instructions
- **Vercel Compatible**: ✅ Yes (no timeout issues)

### Smart Scaling Logic

```javascript
// Per-School Processing
if (imageFiles.length > 1000) {
  // Large school: Generate Excel + README with Firebase links
  return generateLargeSchoolZip(schoolId, imageFiles);
} else {
  // Small school: Generate ZIP with actual images (up to 100)
  return generateStandardZip(schoolId, imageFiles);
}

// All-Schools Processing
if (schoolsSnapshot.docs.length > 50) {
  // Large deployment: Generate Excel files + comprehensive README
  return generateLargeDeploymentZip(schoolDocs);
} else {
  // Small deployment: Generate ZIP with actual images
  return generateStandardAllSchoolsZip(schoolDocs);
}
```
